We actually prefer the Elantra&rsquo;s new angular body than its flowy and curvy design before because it&rsquo;s more subtle but still has the qualities to get your attention. The only thing we think that Hyundai should have considered was to make the Elantra more sporty &ndash; similar to other vehicles in its class. It&rsquo;s like a&nbsp;<em>halo-halo</em>, complete with all the&nbsp;<em>sahogs</em>, but lacks sugar. Not a good idea to use&nbsp;<em>halo-halo</em>&nbsp;as an analogy; we now have to resist our cravings for that cold dessert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d1hv7ee95zft1i.cloudfront.net/custom/blog-post-photo/gallery/59153fb040288.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the cabin, the Elantra has a straightforward design along with a driver-oriented layout. The latter gives the driver the liberty to not lean forward in order to reach the controls. Speaking of which, the controls are organized in such a way that one wouldn&rsquo;t be overwhelmed or confused. In other words, they are well-placed. Hard plastic materials somewhat dominates the entire cabin, but this is tolerable considering the neat layout of the dashboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d1hv7ee95zft1i.cloudfront.net/custom/blog-post-photo/gallery/59153fe940375.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This particular variant comes with fabric seats and audio system that features a CD, MP3, Aux, and USB compatibility. However, this Elantra doesn&rsquo;t have a Bluetooth function. It also doesn&rsquo;t come with speed-sensing door locks and rear backing sensors, as well as one-touch power windows up or down for the driver. On the other hand, these things are made up for with the Elantra&rsquo;s spacious interior. The rear leg- and head-room is decent, giving passengers a comfortable ride. You can let 3 of your healthy 5&rsquo;5&rsquo;&rsquo; friends sit at the back without a problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mid-variant Elantra is powered by a 1.6L gasoline engine.

Your arms wouldn&rsquo;t be subjected to a lot of work thanks to its electronic power steering wheel. It feels light, which gives you a relaxed feel behind the wheel. The weak points we mentioned in the Elantra&rsquo;s interior is further compensated by its good ride comfort. It absorbs road impact well and it doesn&rsquo;t lose its composure when faced with Metro Manila&rsquo;s potholes and dilapidated roads. The Elantra also has a nice cabin acoustics with road and engine noise reduced to a minimum. In terms of fuel economy, the vehicle registered 7 km/l with an average speed of 15 km/h (moderate to heavy traffic).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out on the open highway, the Elantra is stable and planted, which gives you confidence when changing lanes. It delivers enough power with relatively minimum lag, allowing you to overtake slower vehicles with good measure. Moreover, the engine is never short of climbing power when tackling uphill roads and it is doesn&rsquo;t lose its poise going downhill.

Its centrepiece is a new radiator grille which features chrome detailing. It also boasts a bracing set of 3D wraparound headlamps with multi reflector chrome surround fog lamps. The bumpers have also been redesigned with a new front grille to lend a more aggressive look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also features a micro roof antenna, body color door handles and the side indicator lights incorporated on the outside rear view mirror. The rear of new i10 boasts of sleek and elongated tail lamps, bold rear bumper with body colored inserts as well as rear bumper reflectors and trendy full wheel cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interiors[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyundai_i10&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\">edit</a>]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new i10 has a two tone beige and light brown color in certain markets. To impart a more aesthetic appeal, the interiors have been accentuated with chrome and silver accents at multiple points. Other interesting design features like metal finish center console, new instrument cluster, blue interior illumination, etc., have been added to offer a more luxurious and ergonomic experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from this, the i10 brings in a host of highly innovative design features like first in segment gear shift indicator display (M/T only), digital fuel indicator, Bluetooth, steering mounted audio and bluetooth controls and multiple power outlets</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Engines[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyundai_i10&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\">edit</a>]</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>i10 iRDE 1.1[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyundai_i10&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\">edit</a>]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The i10 was launched with a 1.1 liter 65&nbsp;bhp (48&nbsp;kW; 66&nbsp;PS)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-4\">I4</a>&nbsp;iRDE engine, the same motor used in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Picanto\">Kia Picanto</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Atos\">Hyundai Atos Prime/Santro Xing</a>&nbsp;but with lower CO2&nbsp;emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>i10 Kappa 1.2[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyundai_i10&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\">edit</a>]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The i10 also comes with a 1.2 liter gasoline Euro 5 compliant engine (called the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Kappa_engine\">Kappa engine</a>), with the same CO2&nbsp;emissions as the 1.1L version.

Hyundai engineers have taken the existing 1.2 liter four cylinder Kappa engine and added VTVT (Variable Timing and Valve Train). The i10 is the first small car in the country to receive variable valve timing making it, on paper at least, the most sophisticated 1.2 liter engine in its segment (the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Jazz\">Honda Jazz</a>&nbsp;also has an i-VTEC head but is a segment higher).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This system, working on the intake side, helps in altering the valve timing and lift according to the situation and thus improves low end responses and fuel efficiency. VTVT hasn&rsquo;t increased the horsepower and it is still rated at 80&nbsp;PS (59&nbsp;kW; 79&nbsp;hp). However the engine is reported to feel more refined and show very little vibration at higher revs</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Accolades and feats[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyundai_i10&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\">edit</a>]</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyundai i10 was widely recognized as &quot;Car of the Year 2008&quot; by various automotive magazines and television channels in India, like&nbsp;<em>BS Motoring</em>, CNBC-TV18&nbsp;<em>AutoCar</em>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_i10#cite_note-5\">[5]</a>&nbsp;NDTV&nbsp;<em>Profit Car &amp; Bike India</em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_i10#cite_note-6\">[6]</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Overdrive</em>&nbsp;magazine.

Take for instance, the headlamps, which bear a strong resemblance with the pre-facelift i10. The front may look odd to some, especially the wide black plastic base and upright fog lamps, but I liked it from the day I saw it at the exclusive media unveil. I&rsquo;ll also take the liberty to mention here that the overall front design reminds me of the older Porsche Cayenne from front quarters. Agree or disagree?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_150544/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s minimal use of chrome on the outside and it&rsquo;s likeable. The door handles are old-fashioned flappy units, like on the original Santro. Chrome applique on these would have anyway looked overdone, so it&#39;s a good thing Hyundai chose to keep things subtle. Oddly, though, the new Santro doesn&rsquo;t get alloy wheels even on the top variant, and that&rsquo;s a miss in our books. You won&rsquo;t be able to get the Grand i10&rsquo;s alloys fitted onto the Santro, although wheel size on both is 14 inches (PCD is different for both the cars). So you&rsquo;ll have to find the right ones in the aftermarket as Hyundai is still in the process of developing new alloy wheels for the 2018 Santro. On a positive note, absence of alloy wheels (and LED DRLs) in the equipment list means both the Sportz and Asta variants look largely similar on the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181026_183053/570/oem-name0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Santro looks particularly wide at the rear, thanks to the black plastic cladding on both sides of the licence plate on the rear bumper. There&rsquo;s no rear spoiler, which could have made it look sportier, but we&rsquo;re told the hatch will soon get it as an accessory. Overall, unlike the WagonR, the new Santro is not a traditional tallboy. It looks modern. Although it does get Hyundai&rsquo;s signature cascading grille, the front design is distinctive even compared to other Hyundai cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181026_183008/570/oem-name0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interior</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Sets new benchmark for overall interior quality and design</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Black cabin with green inserts and seatbelts on the green exterior colour looks youthful.

Without a doubt, the Santro would make you feel like you&rsquo;re sitting in a shrunken premium hatchback -- it appears that well-built. And with this, it has certainly raised the bar quite high for its peers in terms of interior quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_143729/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk of design and the first thing that will wow you are the propeller-like air conditioning vents on both ends of the dashboard. I have to agree that there&rsquo;s some influence of Mercedes-Benz here -- and while these are not done in metal but in plastic in the Santro, you have to give it to Hyundai for executing these so well that they don&rsquo;t look cheap. Downside is, these vents can&rsquo;t be shut completely and the AC is quite powerful. Adjusting the manual air-con to a lower temperature setting would help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181026_184047/570/oem-name0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driver controls for front and rear power windows are situated near the gear lever instead of the window. Hyundai might have done that to keep costs in check but again, the quality and placement of switches is superb and the Santro doesn&rsquo;t appear to be built to a price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_143951/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few other things that you should know since these might affect your buying decision. The Santro doesn&rsquo;t come with a height-adjustable driver&rsquo;s seat or tilt-adjustable steering. Those with average build won&rsquo;t have an issue getting into a decent driving position, but if you&rsquo;re taller than 6 feet you might feel the need for either tilt steering or height-adjustable driver&rsquo;s seat (to lower it) or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_144156/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rear row gets its own AC vents and with the front seat set to my liking (I&rsquo;m around 5&rsquo;9&rdquo;), there&rsquo;s enough space for someone of my build to sit behind the driver comfortably. So seating 4 average-sized adults shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. But there are no adjustable headrests at the rear, so it&rsquo;s not the best of cars to have if the rear seat is occupied most of the times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_144314/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Santro&rsquo;s cabin is done in a dual-tone colour combination of black and beige. But if you buy the Santro in Diana Green exterior colour, which is available from the Magna variant onwards, you get a black interior with green inserts on the dashboard, around the gear lever and the rear AC vents. What&rsquo;s most striking are the green seatbelts -- youngsters are bound to love them. If I were to buy the Santro, I would buy it in Diana Green exterior colour only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_144515/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like on the outside, there&rsquo;s minimal use of chrome on the inside as well, irrespective of the interior colour combination. Even the Hyundai logo on the steering wheel is not done in chrome. Hyundai might have done that to contain costs, but it&rsquo;s it is not something that I particularly mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_144726/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Santro is not a traditional tallboy hatchback, you don&rsquo;t walk in straight into the cabin. Instead, you&rsquo;re are seated a tad low, especially at the rear. The headroom inside is decent for average-sized adults both at the front and the rear. There&rsquo;s a downward slope around the rear window line that you would appreciate when seated at the rear. It makes the cabin feel airy. Boot space is rated at 235 litres -- that should be enough for a family of four with luggage for a weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the Santro is pitched as a family car and it will do a good job at that -- if the family is nuclear. Adults at the rear will feel the need for headrests over long distances. Older parents, who would otherwise step in or out of the previous Santro, will find the new Santro&rsquo;s seating position a little low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_144953/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk of safety and the new Santro comes with ABS with EBD and driver-side airbag as standard. While that may be at par or more than what the competition offers, a new generation vehicle bearing the &lsquo;Santro&rsquo; moniker was the ideal platform for Hyundai to set a new benchmark in terms of safety. Dual airbags begs to be standard in a vehicle pegged as a &lsquo;family hatchback&rsquo;. For now, only the top Asta variant comes with dual front airbags and front seatbelt pretensioner with load limiter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Technology &amp; Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_145108/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech-wise, there&rsquo;s the 7-inch infotainment system on offer with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Mirror Link on the top two variants. The Santro Magna, the most affordable variant with AMT, gets a 2-DIN audio system, so Hyundai&#39;s got the bases covered on this front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_145224/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare it with its rivals and the rear AC vents is the one major add-on for the Santro. And that&rsquo;s a little disappointing because of three reasons: One, it&rsquo;s a Hyundai product, so we expect more value to be offered in terms of equipment. Two, it&rsquo;s a new-gen product but it has not managed to set a benchmark in terms of features on offer. Three, rivals offer more features than the Santro already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Engine &amp; Transmission</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Hyundai Santro 2018: First Drive Review\" src=\"https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20181027_145459/570/hyundai0.jpg\" style=\"width:816px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the new Santro, Hyundai&rsquo;s got the old 1.1-litre Epsilon engine back that did duty on both the older Santro and the i10. The 4-cylinder engine has been reintroduced for two reasons. One, for the sake of product distinction: the Eon gets a 1.0-litre engine, Santro a 1.1-litre and the Grand i10 a 1.2-litre unit. Two, being a 4-cylinder engine, it&rsquo;s more refined than the Eon&rsquo;s 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder unit.</p>\r\n', 0, 'hf.jpg', 2, '2019-04-22 16:05:28', NULL),

The fruition of that engineering can be acquired in America for just under $30,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Stinger has an exceptional interior space with cutting-edge technologies and is blessed with craftsmanship. The luxury sports sedan has not only good looks but also power to go with it. Its base 2.0-liter twin scroll turbo four-cylinder engine is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stinger gets a gas mileage of 29 mpg highway, 22 mpg city, and 25 mpg combined average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The performance-minded Stinger GT, with the 365 hp turbo V6, goes from a standstill to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and hits a top speed of 167 mph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stinger offers five drive modes&mdash;Eco, Smart, Comfort, Sport, Custom&mdash;that let you adjust throttle and gearbox response plus steering weight for different driving moods and conditions. The stopping power is supplied by four-wheel disc brakes, while high-performance shock absorbers keep the car planted on the road. They all ride on 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped in all-season tires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior is commanded by a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system that has a rear camera, Bluetooth, USB and auxiliary inputs, and SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Smartphone integration is provided through Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/12/12/19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/12/12/19-600x400.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the Stinger. (Courtesy of Kia)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The optional customizable Heads-Up Display projects onto the front windshield, displaying minimum essential information, such as speed, turn-by-turn navigation, audio, and cruise control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rear seating has stretch-out legroom and 60/40 split-folding seats that provide a cavernous luggage space in the back when you need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo; on the inside only accentuates the &ldquo;great stuff&rdquo; on the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main illumination is through projector beam headlights and LED taillights. Even the front door handle pockets are illuminated, complemented by heated outdoor mirrors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long wheelbase gives the Stinger a stable stance, while the dark chrome trim surrounding Kia&rsquo;s trademark &ldquo;tiger nose&rdquo; grille is complemented by an &ldquo;island hood&rdquo; design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the key driving-assist technology is not standard, but for an additional $2,000 you get a full bundle including forward-collision avoidance, lane-departure warning, advanced smart cruise control with stop-and-go, and a lane-keep assist system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something impressive about the Stinger was Kia&rsquo;s aerodynamic design. At high speed, air pressure can build dramatically within the wheel arch, affecting airflow. On the Stinger, vents have been placed behind each front wheel to let the air exit, reducing the pressure buildup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Panels and covers are fitted below the engine and transmission, on each side of the cabin, and over the rear suspension to further improve aerodynamics. The under-body panels allow the air to flow uninterrupted beneath the car in order to reduce lift at high speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could change one feature, I wish the front cabin was a little roomier and the front panel was not quite so crowded. The back seats, however, were wide and quite comfortable for two passengers, and even satisfactory for three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warranty<br />\r\n5-Year/60,000-Mile Limited Basic warranty<br />\r\n10-Year/100,000-Mile Limited Powertrain Warranty<br />\r\n5-Year/60,000-Mile 24/7 Roadside Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Durhl Caussey writes a car column read around the w</em></p>\r\n', 0, 'tiet-lo-bang-gia-xe-vinfast-dong-pre1548130936.jpg', 1, '2019-04-22 16:36:29', NULL),
